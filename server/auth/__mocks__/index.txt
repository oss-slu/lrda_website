It would be extremely useful to mock Auth0 JWT stuff.
We will need to do some manual mocking to make these functions return the expected responses.
Remember we are using ES6 now, so ignore documentation for other syntaxes.  
See https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks#manual-mock
See https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks#manual-mock-that-is-another-es6-class

Remember that responses are Auth0 Responses and would need to be shaped as such.
