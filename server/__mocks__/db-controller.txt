It may be useful to mock the db-controller completely if we aren't testing anything that requires db interaction.
We will need to do some manual mocking to make these functions return the expected responses.
Remember we are using ES6 now, so ignore documentation for other syntaxes.

Remember that responses are a NodeJS Express Response passed down the (req, res, next) chain.
