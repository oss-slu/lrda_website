Find the mobile app repository [here](https://github.com/oss-slu/lrda_mobile)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Information Regarding Keys

This application uses **Firebase** **Google Maps** **ChatGpt** keys. To gain access to the keys for development please get in touch with yashkamal.bhatia@slu.edu.
We are planning to get things dockerized and available for development without needing any keys or online access to servers (aside from Google Maps which you can use your own).
